# zmq_through_cpp_python

It's a simple example code of client-server zmq communication through c++ and python. 
c++-server is based on V120-zmq-lib of VS2013 and python-client through pyzmq.
You can use them in two seperate operation systems for example windows and ubuntu. 
Make sure that two systems can ping to each other. If not, pls check the IP setting or
firewall of windows. You can also use them in the same windows operating system.
